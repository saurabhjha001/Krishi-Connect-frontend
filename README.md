#  CropDash - Kisan Products Dashboard

Hii Everyone! 👋 This is my first React project - a dashboard for farmers to manage their crop products. I built this to help a farmer and wanted a simple way to track his products and prices.

##  What's This Project About?

यह एक सरल डैशबोर्ड है जो किसानों को उनके उत्पादों का प्रबंधन करने में मदद करता है। (This is a simple dashboard that helps farmers manage their products.)

I wanted to make something useful for Indian farmers, so I added Hindi language support and included important government schemes too!

## ✨ Features I've Built

- 🌐 Hindi/English language toggle
- 📊 Product list with prices and market rates
- 💰 Price difference calculator
- 🏛️ Government schemes information
- 🎯 Rotating farmer slogans
- 📱 Mobile-friendly design
- 🎨 Clean and simple UI with Tailwind CSS

## 🛠️ Tools I Used

- React (my first time using it!)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- JSON Server for mock API
- React Router for navigation
- Context API for language switching

##  How to Run

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Start the mock server: `npm run server`
4. In another terminal: `npm run dev`
5. Open `http://localhost:5173`

## 📁 My Project Structure

```
src/
  ├── components/     # Reusable UI parts
  ├── pages/         # Main pages
  ├── context/       # Language settings
  ├── services/      # API calls
  └── App.jsx        # Main app file
```

## 🤖 How AI Helped Me

I used Cursor and ChatGPT to:
- Plan the project structure
- Learn about React best practices
- Get help with Tailwind CSS
- Debug tricky issues

But I made all the decisions about:
- What features to include
- How to structure the code
- Which UI components to use
- How to handle the data

## 📚 What I Learned

- React hooks and components
- Tailwind CSS styling
- Context API for state management
- How to use mock APIs
- Responsive design basics

## 🔮 Future Plans

- Add real backend (maybe Firebase,express.js or node.js later)
- User authentication
- More language options
- Price history charts
- Weather integration
- Mobile app version
