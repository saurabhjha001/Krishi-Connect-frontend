## 💻 Frontend ↔ Backend Integration

To ensure Vercel frontend connects with Render backend:

* API calls are pointed to live Render URLs:

```js
const API_BASE = "https://crop-backend.onrender.com/api/products";
```

* CORS is enabled on the backend using:

```js
const cors = require('cors');
app.use(cors());
```

* Frontend fetches, posts, and deletes data using this live API.

## 🧠 Smart Functionality with AI Support

This project was built with the help of **ChatGPT (via Cursor AI)** to brainstorm, generate, and improve features.

### ✨ Sample Prompts I Used:

> “How do I show profit/loss percentage between two prices with ₹ unit?”

> “Make product list more professional and Hindi/English switch friendly”

> “Add dropdown to quantity input for unit types like kg, ton, etc.”

> “Connect Vercel frontend to Render backend using proper CORS setup”

> “Fix 404 and live deploy error on Netlify and switch to Vercel”

> “Create a farmer-friendly home page with Hindi slogans and gov links”

All prompts were written in a mix of English and Hinglish, just like how I naturally think while building. Yeh project banaane mein AI ne kaafi smart suggestive help ki — but implementation, testing, and debugging maine khud kiya 💪

## 🚀 Backend Overview

* **Framework**: Express.js
* **Endpoints**:

  * `GET /api/products`: Fetch all products

## 🧾 Final Notes

* Product calculations are per unit based and include bulk logic
* Autocomplete inputs + dropdowns + gov links enhance usability
* Entire project built from scratch, no templates used
